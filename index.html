      <i><b>Limbus Company</b></i> is an <a href="/wiki/Indie_game" title="Indie game">indie</a> strategy <a href="/wiki/Role-playing_video_game" title="Role-playing video game">role-playing video game</a> for <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and mobile devices using iOS or Android,<sup id="cite_ref-QnA_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-QnA-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> developed and published by <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korean</a> studio Project Moon.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>2<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> It was released worldwide on February 26, 2023. The game is set in the same dystopian, hyper-<a href="/wiki/Capitalist" class="mw-redirect" title="Capitalist">capitalist</a> world known only as "The City", where all of Project Moon's other works take place, including <i><a href="/wiki/Lobotomy_Corporation" title="Lobotomy Corporation">Lobotomy Corporation</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Library_of_Ruina" title="Library of Ruina">Library of Ruina</a></i>, and multiple webcomics such as <i>Leviathan</i> and <i>The Distortion Detective</i>, but takes place some time after the events of all those stories.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>3<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      The game contains <a href="/wiki/Gacha_game" title="Gacha game">gacha</a> elements, making it possible to spend real money to acquire Lunacy (the <a href="/wiki/In-game_currency" class="mw-redirect" title="In-game currency">in-game currency</a>) or tickets used to acquire new Sinner Identities or their respective Extermination of Geometrical Organ (E.G.O) outside of the base units given to the player. Director Kim Ji-hoon claimed during a Q&amp;A session that this was necessary both to fund and explore making new Project Moon games, such as a currently unnamed "3rd-person Action RPG" set in the City, and that a <a href="/wiki/Live_service_game" class="mw-redirect" title="Live service game">live service game</a> would expand the fanbase and keep them entertained in-between full retail releases.<sup id="cite_ref-QnA_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-QnA-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Players can use Lunacy or certain tickets to summon alternate Identities and E.G.O. that can be equipped by their respective Sinner to use in battle. The alternate Identity can radically change how the Sinner acts in combat, and might be more useful for different stages than their default Identity. However, each alternate Identity has to be built up separately. When entering a battle stage, the player is able to choose up to 7 out of 12 Sinners (not including Dante) to fight, and must balance each Sinner's strengths and weaknesses to emerge victorious. The player must choose both the Sinner's Identity and the E.G.O that they want to take with them into battle. The player cannot use multiple Identities of the same Sinner, and likewise cannot attach multiple E.G.O of the same power level to the Sinner. Once they have made their selections, the battle starts.</p>
    <p>In normal fights, the player can drag their pointer across the circles representing each Sinner's attack, either to form a chain of attacks with similar Sin categories or to use the attack that best fits the situation. In battles against bosses or Abnormalities, players instead will be directed to pick and choose which Sinner's attack should correspond to which enemy, or a specific body part of the enemy they wish to attack. Once they have made their choice, the battle phase begins. The game decides which side's attacks are successful with a series of coin flips. A coin landing on heads will add a numbered boost to the character's power (with the exception of certain skills from various other identities, in which power is instead subtracted), while a tails will leave the number as it currently stands. A character's respective Sanity Points (SP) determines their luck in getting heads from the coins. After the clashes are resolved and damage added up, the battle phase resets and new attacks can be launched, until one side is wiped out.</p>
    <p>The player can choose to attack using a Sinner's respective E.G.O in place of their normal attack. However, doing so requires spending the Sinner's SP, and collected "Sin" of certain categories from normal attacks, to feed the E.G.O and then use it on the enemy. If a Sinner's SP is low enough, they may choose to launch a "corroded" E.G.O on their own, which is more powerful but cannot be controlled by the player. The Sinner will randomly target enemies or allies with this corroded E.G.O until they regain some SP.</p>
    <p>Outside of normal stages, there are dungeon maps where the player must choose a route that eventually leads towards the final boss of the dungeon, and defeat them to finish the stage. Unlike other stages, dungeon maps force players to strategize, as they are stuck with the Sinners' Identity and E.G.O chosen at the start of the map and do not automatically heal between battles. Some rooms or boss fights will force the player to make a choice where the correct answer is not always obvious, and passing the check may involve using a Sinner's respective Sin Affinity in order to pass through without harm.</p>
